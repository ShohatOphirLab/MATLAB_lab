%BOUT STATISTICS -- not converted to multivariate yet
%
%Create a table of bout lengths (BL) and inter-bout lengths (IBL) using the
%"Bout Stats" button.  As for behavior stats, each row is a behavior;  the
%columns break it down by sex and individual;  the experiment groups are
%striped;  logical operators can be applied; and the Prefs contextual menu
%controls statistics.
%
%Selecting a cell plots a histogram, normalized to unit area, of bout and
%inter-bout lengths.  The "LogY" and "Stats" buttons can be used to scale
%the axis and overlay summary statistics, respectively.  Multiple selected
%cells are overlayed.
